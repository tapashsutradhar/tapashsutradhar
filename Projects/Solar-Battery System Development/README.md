# Solar-Battery System Development

Led the design and testing of a compact solar-battery system for off-grid applications in rural settings. Responsibilities included: <br>
•	Designing the wiring layout and selecting circuit protection devices to ensure field safety and maintainability. <br>
•	Developing basic charge/discharge control logic tailored for low-cost deployment. <br>
•	Assisting in prototype construction, conducting performance and safety testing, and compiling detailed documentation: wiring schematics, bill of materials, and test data. <br>
This project emphasized the critical role of clarity, safety, and reliability in real-world system deployment.
