# E-Bicycle Speed Controller 


## Containts



## Project Overview

The E-Bicycle Speed Controller project aims to design and implement a microcontroller-based system for efficient and safe speed regulation of an electric bicycle. This system combines both hardware and software elements to provide real-time monitoring and control of the motor speed based on input from sensors and throttle position.

## Objective

Develop a reliable speed control system for an e-bicycle.
Implement embedded hardware and software integration.
Enable speed regulation based on throttle input and motor feedback.
Enhance safety and battery efficiency.
