# Projects I have done - 

## <strong> - Solar-Battery System Development (Field Prototype Project) </strong>

   <em> I worked on the design and testing of a small-scale solar-battery system intended for off-grid use in rural areas. I was responsible for the wiring layout, selecting protection devices, and developing a simple charge/discharge control logic. I also helped build a prototype, ran performance and safety tests, and documented the full system design — including wiring schematics, bill of materials, and test results. That experience really highlighted how important clarity, safety, and reliability are when systems are deployed in the field. </em> <br> <br>
  Led the design and testing of a compact solar-battery system for off-grid applications in rural settings. Responsibilities included: <br>
 •	Designing the wiring layout and selecting circuit protection devices to ensure field safety and maintainability. <br>
 •	Developing basic charge/discharge control logic tailored for low-cost deployment. <br>
 •	Assisting in prototype construction, conducting performance and safety testing, and compiling detailed documentation: wiring schematics, bill of materials, and test data. <br>
This project emphasized the critical role of clarity, safety, and reliability in real-world system deployment. <br> <br>

## <strong> - Smart Energy Monitor (University Team Project) </strong>

<em>   During university, I was part of a team project to develop a smart energy monitor for home use. I focused on integrating sensor hardware (voltage and current sensors) with a microcontroller **(Arduino)**, and wrote firmware to transmit data over Modbus. We built a basic dashboard to display real-time power usage, and I worked on validating the accuracy of sensor readings compared to a calibrated multimeter. It taught me a lot about communication protocols, noise handling, and the importance of clear documentation, especially when sharing work in a team. </em> <br> <br>
  Worked on a smart home energy monitoring system, integrating voltage and current sensors with an Arduino-based microcontroller. <br>
 •	Wrote Modbus firmware for real-time data transmission. <br>
 •	Developed a simple dashboard to visualize power usage. <br>
 •	Calibrated and validated sensor outputs against a precision multimeter. <br>
Gained experience in serial communication, signal noise reduction, and the value of clean, well-shared documentation in collaborative environments. <br>

## <strong> - Personal & Course Projects </strong>

 •	Built a **Wireless mobile charging station** using reclaimed materials for community use. <br>
 •	Experimented with **CAN bus messaging and real-time data parsing** as part of an **EV battery management system** assignment. <br>
Enjoy solving system-level problems, iterating on test setups, and learning from hands-on feedback. <br>

 -	I’ve also done some personal projects like <br>
 
 - **IoT-Based Smart Home Automation and Monitoring System** <br>
   <em> Designed a real-time monitoring and control platform using Arduino/Raspberry Pi, IoT sensors, and a mobile app, enabling users to remotely operate lights, fans, and appliances. </em> <br>
• Improved home energy efficiency by 40% and enhanced remote control capabilities by developing an smart home system. <br>
• Implemented Wi-Fi and MQTT protocols for seamless communication and automated scheduling to optimize energy consumption. <br>

 - **Smart Energy Management System with IoT, AI, and Renewable Integration** <br>
 <em> This project is a Smart Energy Management System (SEMS) that monitors, predicts, and optimizes power usage in real-time using IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Renewable Energy sources. Achieved 15-30% energy savings through AI-based optimization. </em>
 
I enjoy working through the logic of systems, iterating on test setups, and learning from hands-on results.
