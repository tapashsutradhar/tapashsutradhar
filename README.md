```md
# When you run the app (npm run dev), browser will open a clean dashboard page with a few main sections:


Top row → cards showing KPIs:
- Total Revenue
- Total Orders
- Units Sold
- Average Order Value

Filters → dropdowns and date pickers to narrow down by category, region, or time.

Charts →
- Line chart of sales over time
- Pie chart of sales by region
- Bar chart of top categories

Data Table → preview of the raw CSV rows with an option to export filtered data back out to CSV.

How to use it:
--------------

Open the app in your browser (http://localhost:5173/).

Click the “Upload CSV” button.

Yes, you need to upload a CSV 📂 (otherwise the dashboard has no data to analyze).

# The file should have columns like:

OrderID,Date,Customer,Product,Category,Quantity,Price,Region


Once uploaded, the KPIs, charts, and table will auto-populate from your data.

Play with the filters (date range, region, category) to slice and dice.

If you want, export the filtered table back out to CSV.
```
